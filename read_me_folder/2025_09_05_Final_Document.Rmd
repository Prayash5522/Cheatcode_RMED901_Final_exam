# Cheatcode_RMED901_Final_exam
Final group work 

###--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------###
## Introduction
# The UiB organized a two weeks course on R programming language for the PhD students in the medical faculty. The overall aim of # the course is to equip students with the valuable skills in data management, data analysis, visualization, and coding.        # During the two weeks course we learned the basics of R and we worked with the historical clinical trial dataset to practice   # data handling and analysis. The dataset comes from the 1948 Streptomycin for Tuberculosis trial whereby 107 were randomly     # assigned to take either sterptomycin (2g) daily or placebo. The dataset has been adopted for teaching purposes and contains   # information on patient demographics, baseline conditions, treatment assignment and six month outcomes.
